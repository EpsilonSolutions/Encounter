Encounter is a software library aimed at providing a production-grade
implementation of cryptographic counters.

A cryptographic counters is a public string representing an encryption 
of a quantity, satisfying the following properties:

1. Subjects with access to the *public-key* can update the 
   encrypted counter by an arbitrary amount, by means of increment
   or decrement operations and without first decrypting the value 
   (i.e., the operation is performed over encrypted data);

2. The plaintext value is hidden from all participants except the entity
   holding some secret key;

3. The adversary can only learn if the cryptographic counter was
   updated (i.e., information about whether the counter was incremented
   or decremented is kept hidden to all participants except the
   secret-key holder and the updating entity).


Applications
============

Possible applications of cryptographic counters include:

- Privacy-preserving statistics gathering in a honest-but-curious 
  threat-model;
- Secure electronic voting;
- Digital Rights Management.



Mechanisms
==========

Encounter will support different cryptocounters schemes, with different
security/performance trade-offs. 

To date, Encounter implements a cryptocounter based on the Paillier 
public-key cryptographic scheme - please, see below the credits section.

The Paillier PKCS is additive homomorphic cryptosystem providing
semantic security against chosen-plaintext attacks (IND-CPA)
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paillier_cryptosystem>

Encounter provides a mean to diminish the possibility of correlations.
In fact, users can probabilistically re-encrypt Paillier-based 
cryptocounter without changing the underlying value. Please, refer to
function encounter_touch().



Credits

The Paillier-based cryptocounter code is based on the implementation by
Adam Young and Moti Yung in their clever Malicious Cryptography and the
upcoming Advances in Cryptovirology <http://www.cryptovirology.com/>


Encounter implements a speed-up technique described in Paillier's
